linguine (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low
  * With help from Marxian, the screen backlight now stays on while videos are playing.
  * With help from Marxian, links in the text RSS display are now opened in the default web browser, rather than in Linguine itself.
  * With help from Marxian, the text RSS display should now be displayed in the same color scheme as the user's chosen theme.
  * Thanks Marxian!

  * Switched to a category-based filtering system.  Categories are now displayed at the top of the main screen in a scrollable tab bar.
  * Inital support added for textual RSS news feeds.  Text newsfeeds are displayed as html in a new window using a qwebview widget.
  * Audio and video players now support "seeking" to an arbitrary location in the podcast.

linguine (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Major improvement to video display: by locking the screen to landscape mode whenever a video is running, the video player no longer crashes.
  * Several bug fixes, including one that caused XML files loaded by the user to be ignored.
  * A few new podcasts: The Guardian's weekly political show, TruthDig's weekly political show, On Point with Tom Ashbrook's weekly news discussion, a pair of Radio France International daily newscasts, a Spanish "24 Horas" daily news show, the German Tagesschau daily news summary, and the BBC Russian Service.  (As an English speaker, I can't really vouch for the quality of the non-English podcasts...)  Also, a new video podcast, the left-leaning Democracy Now! daily news program.
