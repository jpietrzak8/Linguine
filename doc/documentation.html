Linguine Instant News & Politics App

<h1>Linguine Documentation</h1>

<p>
Linguine is an app that provides quick access to news and political
opinion from around the world.  The app retrieves and collates RSS data
from numerous podcasters; it then presents a list of the most recent
podcasts from these sources.  When an item on the list is selected,
the corresponding podcast will be streamed over the net and played
on your phone.
</p>

<h2>Using Linguine</h2>

<p>
Linguine has two main windows, the "List" window and the "Player" window.
In general, the "List" window organizes and displays the list of available
podcasts, and the "Player" window plays a podcast when it is selected
from the list.
</p>

<h3>The "List" Window</h3>

<p>
The "List" window will provide information on the available list of
podcasts; generally, this will include a small image and the title for
each podcast, taken from the RSS information retrieved.  Please note that,
when first starting Linguine, it may take some time for the list to be
fully populated, as there may be many RSS files to download.
</p>

<p>
There are two combo boxes at the bottom of the window; the one on the left
filters podcasts based on how frequently they are updated.  So, if you select
"Hourly", only podcasts that update every hour will be shown; if you select
"Daily", podcasts that only update once every 24 hours will be shown.  (Some
podcasts, such as the BBC Newshour, update twice daily; however, they have
been placed into the "Daily" collection as well.)
</p>

<p>
The combo box on the right allows you to choose the category of the podcast.
For now, the only categories available are "News" and "Politics"; this will
likely be expanded in future updates.  You can also choose the "Any" option
here, which will select all podcasts regardless of category.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is a drop-down menu available for the app.  The current
options are "Load Newsfeeds File", which will allow you to load a custom
XML file containing a different set of newsfeeds; "Documentation", which
will display this file; and "About", which provides some general information
about the app.
</p>

<h3>The "Player" Window</h3>

<p>
The "Player" window provides a very simple mechanism for playing audio and
video data.  For audio podcasts, an image and title for the podcast is
displayed, as well as a percentage of how much of the media has been played.
There are three control buttons available; a play/pause button, a stop
button, and an "info" button that provides some general information taken
from GStreamer.
</p>

<h4>Notes on Video</h4>

<p>
Please note that, as of the current version of Linguine, there are several
problems with video playback.  The mechanism currently used to display
video data is unable to work correctly when the N900 is in portrait
orientation; you will need to keep the phone in landscape mode in order to
see video.  Moreover, this mechanism also has significant trouble dealing
with changes to the size or location of its output window; in particular,
the video may be dropped if the phone is rotated from landscape to portrait
and back.
</p>

<p>
These issues are due mainly to the very old version of GStreamer in use
on the N900.  Future updates to Linguine may be able to address this problem.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: As of version 0.1.1, some improvements have been made: the video should
no longer break down if the screen orientation changes.  (This is due to the
simple fix of forcing the orientation to always be in landscape when playing
a video.)  Hopefully, more improvements will be availble in the future.
